**What is that?**

You can move or replace any Index of Array .
Thats means you easily move any item of array easily.

```
import from 'array-index-change'
const array1=[1,3,6]
arrayIndexChange = ( array1, old_index, new_index, 'before' );

arrayIndexChange = ( array1, 1, 0, 'after' );
restult is
[3,1,6]
```
